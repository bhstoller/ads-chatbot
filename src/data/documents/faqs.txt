- Which Master's in Applied Data Science provides students with visas?									
									
									

																					Only the full-time, In-Person program is eligible for visa sponsorship. Applicants who need visa sponsorship are highly encouraged to apply to the earlier rounds.
- What is the total cost of tuition for the Master's in Applied Data Science program?									
									
									

																					As part of the I-20 or DS-2019 request process, the Office of International Affairs will conduct a thorough review of financial documentation (e.g. bank statements, letter(s) of support, etc.) to verify that international students have access to the total cost of attendance which includes tuition, student fees, health insurance, books and supplies, and living expenses.
- Is the Master's in Applied Data Science an approved OPT/STEM program?									
									
									

																					Yes. Please visit the University of Chicago Office of International Affairs website for more information.
- Does the Master's in Applied Data Science program offer Curricular Practical Training (CPT)?									
									
									

																					Yes. Eligible students must be enrolled full-time for one academic year (or three consecutive quarters) to qualify. Students must also be able to present an employment offer letter to complete the application process. Please visit the University of Chicago Office of International Affairs website for more information.
- I have worked in the U.S. for more than two years. Does that mean that I am exempt from the TOEFL/IELTS requirement?									
									
									

																					No, you must take the TOEFL or IELTS if you do not meet the waiver criteria. Please refer to the University of Chicago’s English Language Proficiency requirements and the English Language Proficiency section of the FAQs for more details.
- If I am a student in the In-Person Master's in Applied Data Science Program, may I take courses in the Online Program? Conversely, if I am a student in the Online Program, may I take courses in the In-Person program? 									
									
									

																					Currently, students may only take Master’s in Applied Data Science courses in the modality in which they are officially enrolled.
- Do I need to be a US citizen or permanent resident to apply to Master's in Applied Data Science Online Program?									
									
									

																					No, students do not have to be US citizen or resident to partake in the Online Program. Please note that the Online Program is not eligible for visa sponsorship.
- How will enrolling in Master's in Applied Data Science Online Program impact my schedule? Are classes held synchronously, asynchronously, or both?									
									
									

																					Classes generally take place on evenings and weekends in order to allow our students and instructors to maintain their professional schedules. The Master’s in Applied Data Science Online Program is both synchronous and asynchronous. The same as our In-Person program, students are required to participate in weekly, live meetings with their instructors and peers, complete readings and coursework, and engage in discussion.
- Will enrolling in Master's in Applied Data Science Online Program give me the opportunity to network with on-campus students, faculty/instructors, and advisors?									
									
									

																					Yes. All Master’s in Applied Data Science Online Program students are invited to an annual ‘Immersion Weekend’ where attendees have opportunities to network and participate in other activities. On a rolling basis, our Career Services team will advertise additional opportunities to connect with employers and peers (e.g., virtual career fairs, virtual career advising/coaching appointments, and more).
- What value do employers place on the Master's in Applied Data Science Online degree?									
									
									

																					The value employers place on the Master’s in Applied Data Science degree is significant. As they hire Data Scientist, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts from the University of Chicago the expectations for technical competence, communication and influence skills, and exposure to advanced Data Science evolving technologies is high. The skills learned in the program translate directly into practice due to the program’s balance between theory and rigorous application experience developed in coursework and the Capstone project work delivered across the curriculum.
- Is the Master's in Applied Data Science Online program equally academically rigorous as the In-Person program? 									
									
									

																					Yes. The Online Program curriculum is overseen by the same faculty curriculum committee as the In-Person program. Both programs are jointly reviewed and are held to the same high standards. Additionally, both programs are granted by the University of Chicago Physical Sciences Division.
- Will my diploma indicate I completed the Master's in Applied Data Science Program Online?									
									
									

																					No, your diploma will not include ‘Online’ in the name of your degree.
- How do I apply to the MBA/MS joint degree program?									
									
									

																					Applicants interested in the Joint MBA/MS degree will apply through Booth’s centralized, joint-application process. Applicants should complete the Chicago Booth Full-Time MBA application and select the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science as their program of interest. An MBA/MS program supplement will be available for completion within your Booth application. The supplement contains Applied Data Science specific questions that will be reviewed by the Applied Data Science admissions team along with your full Booth application. For complete consideration, applicants should complete the MBA application and the joint degree program supplement in the same application round prior to submitting the application.
- What courses will I take in the MBA/MS program? 									
									
									

																					As a student in the joint-degree MBA and Applied Data Science program, you’ll take the equivalent of 23 100-unit courses:

14 MBA classes
9 data science courses
Leadership Effectiveness and Development (LEAD)
Qualified Work Experience, a noncredit professional internship experience

Your Booth courses will be in person, while your MS courses will be online. Most students will earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA.
- 14 MBA classes

- Will MBA/MS courses be in-person or online? 									
									
									

																					Your Booth courses will be in person, while your MS courses will be online. Most students will earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA. A combination of online and in-person courses gives you flexibility in course scheduling, and you’ll earn two degrees in the time it would take to complete the MBA alone.
- Are standardized tests required for admission? 									
									
									

																					As part of the online application, candidates will be required to submit a GMAT or GRE score for the joint program. International applicants may be required to submit proof of English language proficiency by submitting a TOEFL iBT or IELTS test score. The minimum TOEFL iBT score required for admission is 104; the minimum IELTS score required is 7. Proof of English proficiency may be waived under certain criteria noted by UChicago GRAD Admissions.
- What are the main differences in programs and outcomes between the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science compared to Computer Science? 									
									
									

																					The fields of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science intersect with industry domains in different ways. The MPCS program focuses on the center of Computer Science, including Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and Application Development. The MS-ADS Program focuses at the intersection of multiple fields, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics (including Statistical Inference, Linear/Non-Linear Models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning). The outcomes for MPCS students include Software Engineer (Developer), Senior Software Engineering Management, Software/Hardware Architect, and Senior Cyber Security Engineer. The outcomes for students in MS-ADS include roles as Data Scientist (most common), Senior Data Science Consultant, Business Intelligence (BI) Director, Data Visualization Manager, Data Analytics Engineer, and AI Solution Architect.
